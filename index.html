<p> Brittany Pearl is an Associate in Global Education at Est&eacute;e Lauder as a Conference Planner, Beauty Advisor Website Support along with many other responsibliles.</p>

<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
</p> I was recently promoted at Est&eacute;e Lauder from an assitant to an associate. This was a big accomplishment for me. Beauty Education is something that I am passoinate about because I feel like it offers me an experience to not just teach but to write, design and plan. With the launch of our Beauty Advisor website we have been able to help our salesforce learn in a fun and engaging way</p>
